// In your own words, explain how object literals are used to store related
// information and why that is useful.
// Write a short program in which you create two objects whose properties
// describe fictional characters. Output both objects to the console.
// Write a small program that does the following:
// Create an object using object literal syntax with at least five properties.
// For example, your object might represent a person and include properties for
// name, age, number of children, etc.
// Output the object directly to the console.
// Write a string that describes the object using the properties you created.
// For example, "Dan is a 35 year old father of 2 kids." Be sure to access the
// properties using the dot property accessor.
// Change the value of one of the properties using dot notation.
// Add a new property to the object using dot notation.
// Output the object directly to the console.
// Write a new string that describes the object using all of the object's
// properties. Be sure to include the property you just created.
